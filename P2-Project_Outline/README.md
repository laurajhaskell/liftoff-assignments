### What I'll Have to Learn
React

(If I do not use Spotify user login authentication....)
To store user's username, password, created playlists, added or deleted tracks, I will need to store data in Mongo or Firebase.

Node.js

To access a track database with audio features (including track tempo), I will need use the appropriate authentication to retrieve data from the Spotify API.
