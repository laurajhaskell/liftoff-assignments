## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a search web application that allows runners to find a track and its corresponding tempo (beats per minute). It will allow runners to build playlists based on track tempos that match their running pace.

This project was motivated by runners associating track tempos with their energy level, motivation and pace.
### Features
- User login: Users will be able to create an account or use the third-party authentication provider, Spotify.
- Search: Users will be able to search for tracks by track name. Search results will consist of a card with the track name and artist with the corresponding tempo.
- Create playlist: Users will be able to create and name playlists. Any track can be added to a playlist. Users can build them based on their pace needs.
- Add/delete track from playlist: Users will be able to add or delete tracks from playlists they have created.
### Technologies
- JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- Spotify API
- Mongo or Firebase?
- Boostrap
### What I'll Have to Learn
To implement the features, I will need to learn React to build app components.

To start and test the app, I will need to learn how run the app in development mode using Node.

*If I do not use Spotify user login authentication...*
To store username, password, created playlists and added or deleted tracks, I will need to use Mongo or Firebase. I will need to learn how to store and retrieve users' data.

To access a track database with audio features (including track tempo), I will need use the appropriate authentication to retrieve data from the Spotify API. I will need to learn how to request and display data from this API.
